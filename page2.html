  <h3>Re-wilding</h3>
<div>
  <p>Living at the edge of an urban green belt, the obvious ecologically responsible thing to do is to try and alleviate the impact a new-built has had on the surrounding environment. One aspect of this is to encourage biodiversity and seize even the tiniest opportunities for re-wilding in my own back yard.</p>

  <h5>What does your hedge say about you?</h5>
  <p>The naturalistic planing approach adopted by my municipality in recent years is delightful, but the private gardens of neighbourhoods still tend to feature neatly mowed lawns, clipped hedges, ordered planting, and clean, hard landscaping. My own approach has been to select wildlife-friendly planting and limit practices that disencourage biodiversity, such as mowing the lawn and clearing leaf waste. I am determined not to feel apologetic about the mess in my yard. In fact, I want to take my eco-acts a step further and try my hand at productive planting that nurtures the soil as well.</p>

  <h3>Synecoculture</h3>
  <p>Synecoculture is a farming principle based on <strong>ecological optimum</strong>, where plant growth is maximized by making use of the competing symbiosis of multiple species in an ecosystem. By increasing both species and genetic diversity, we also encourage adaptation to environmental conditions. By exploiting the natural characteristics of plants, we remove the need for fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and even tilling, potentially even watering.</p>
